# GRC Technology Implementation & Optimization â€“ Nexus Global

This project simulates the enterprise-wide implementation of an integrated GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) platform for **Nexus Global**, a diversified company with siloed and outdated compliance processes. The goal was to centralize GRC operations, streamline workflows, and provide real-time visibility into risk and compliance posture.

> ðŸŽ¯ This initiative reflects the practical execution of GRC digitizationâ€”from platform selection through rollout, testing, adoption, and long-term governance.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Focus Areas

### 1. GRC Platform Selection
- Defined business, technical, and functional requirements.
- Conducted market research and vendor analysis (e.g., ServiceNow GRC, RSA Archer).
- Managed RFI/RFP process, PoC testing, and final selection using structured evaluation criteria.

### 2. Platform Implementation & Data Migration
- Created a phased implementation roadmap with sandbox testing.
- Migrated legacy risk and audit data using automated tools.
- Mapped internal processes to the platform and planned integrations (e.g., SIEM, HRIS).

### 3. Customization, Testing & User Adoption
- Customized dynamic dashboards, risk scoring models, and workflows.
- Stress-tested the system under simulated load conditions.
- Led a user-first adoption strategy focused on simplicity, continuous feedback, and vendor collaboration.

### 4. Governance, Training & Continuous Optimization
- Defined platform governance roles (admins, data owners, GRC leads).
- Rolled out structured training and knowledge-sharing programs.
- Built mechanisms for ongoing platform enhancement via user feedback loops and vendor collaboration.
